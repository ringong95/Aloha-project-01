# Aloha project part 1

## The goal was to build a website similar to an image that was given.

### Link to my website : <https://shamu92.github.io/Aloha-project-01/>

#### This project was done using HTML and CSS.

###### I made a webpage for Aloha Apparel using the things that we learned the first week of class.

###### The web page is currently optimized for a mobile screen. I was having trouble adding the media query in order to optimize it for larger screens.

###### I used the images that were given and downloaded fonts from font awesome.
